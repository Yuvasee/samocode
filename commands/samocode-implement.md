Run samocode to implement the plan.

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read `skills/samocode-run/SKILL.md` and follow its steps exactly. Do NOT improvise or manually orchestrate phases.

Watch it continuously until the work is completely finished, restart in case of failures.

**Context saving:** This is a long run. While watching, read only minimal necessary data to see progress (prefer `_overview.md` over task output files).
