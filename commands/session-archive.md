Archive a session or archive work within a session: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage patterns:**
- `/session-archive` - Archive entire active session
- `/session-archive [name]` - Archive named session
- `/session-archive keep file1.md file2.md` - Archive work, keep specified files
- `/session-archive [path] keep file.md` - Archive work in specific session

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST read `skills/session-management/SKILL.md` and follow the "Action: archive" section step by step. Do NOT improvise — the skill contains critical steps (worktree removal, partial vs full archive) that must be followed exactly.
